We're building an Online Event Registration Portal for a technical symposium.
It should:

Allow participants to register (via an HTML form)

Display event details dynamically

Look good on all devices (responsive design)

Validate input and preview data before submission

HTML5 - Structure & Forms

We'll start with semantic HTML5 structure to make it clean and accessible.

Key Features:

Use appropriate input types (email, tel, date, etc.)

Use <datalist> for suggestions (like college names or events)

Include a section for event info

CSS3 - Styling & Layout

We'll combine CSS3 and Bootstrap.
CSS handles custom looks, Bootstrap ensures responsiveness.

CSS Features Used:

Box model for spacing/padding/margins

Rounded corners for modern look

Media queries for mobile optimization

JavaScript + jQuery - Behavior & Validation

We'll make the form interactive:

Focus/blur  highlight fields

Submit event  validate & show preview

Dynamic display  show preview before final submission

Bootstrap - Responsiveness Made Easy

Bootstrap ensures:

Columns align nicely on all devices

Buttons and forms adapt automatically

Classes like container, row, col-md-6 simplify the layout
