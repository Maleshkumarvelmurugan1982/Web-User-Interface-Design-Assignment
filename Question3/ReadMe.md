1. HTML5 – Structure & Forms

We use semantic HTML5 elements like header, main, section, and footer to maintain a clear and accessible page layout.

Key Features:

Travel Search Form: The form allows users to enter travel details using suitable input types:

text with autocomplete for destination names.

date for selecting travel and return dates.

range to select the budget or number of travelers.

Destination Section: A dedicated section displays available destinations with images, descriptions, and a Book Now button.

Booking Form: Includes user details, travel preferences, and validation before confirming the booking.

This structure ensures accessibility and logical flow throughout the page.

2. CSS3 – Styling & Layout

We combine CSS3 and Bootstrap to make the webpage attractive and well-organized.

CSS Features Used:

Positioning: Used relative and absolute positioning to overlay text on destination images for a modern card layout.

Box Shadows: Added soft shadows around destination cards to highlight them and create depth.

Rounded Corners: Applied to buttons and images for a smooth, appealing look.

Media Queries: Used to adjust image size, text, and card layout for smaller screens, ensuring good readability on mobiles and tablets.

3. JavaScript + DOM Scripting – Dynamic Behavior

JavaScript makes the page interactive and data-driven.

JavaScript Functions:

Dynamic Destination Loading: When a user searches or selects a category, JavaScript dynamically loads relevant destination details such as image, price, rating, and description.

Form Validation: Validates booking details such as name, email, and travel dates before confirming.

Interactive Range Display: Displays the selected budget value live beside the range input to improve usability.

DOM Manipulation:
Used document.getElementById() and innerHTML to update the destination list and booking details dynamically without reloading the page.

4. jQuery – Smooth Interactions

jQuery simplifies UI interactions and adds a polished user experience.

jQuery Features Used:

Search Filtering: As the user types in the search box, jQuery filters visible destinations in real time based on keywords.

Smooth Scrolling: When clicking navigation links such as “Top Destinations” or “Book Now,” the page scrolls smoothly to the relevant section using the animate() function.

Interactive Effects: Added slide and fade effects for showing or hiding booking confirmation messages.

5. Bootstrap – Components & Responsiveness

Bootstrap ensures the Travel Booking page looks clean and works seamlessly on all screen sizes.

Bootstrap Features Used:

Modals: Used for the booking confirmation pop-up that appears after successful validation.

Buttons: Stylish, prebuilt Bootstrap buttons such as btn-primary and btn-success for actions like Search, Book Now, and Confirm Booking.

Badges: Display quick highlights such as “20% OFF” or “Popular” on destination cards.

Grid System: container, row, and col-md-4 help in arranging destination cards responsively across desktops, tablets, and mobiles.

6. Ensuring Usability Across All Devices

Used Bootstrap’s responsive grid for auto-adjusting the layout.
